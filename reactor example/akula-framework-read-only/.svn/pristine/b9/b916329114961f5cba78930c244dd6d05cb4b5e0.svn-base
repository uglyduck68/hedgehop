/**
LEADERS/FOLLOWERS pattern, described very well from D.Schmidt
Try google.com for "lf.pdf"

The following collaborations occur in the Leader/Followers pattern.
===> Leader thread demultiplexing. The leader thread waits for an event to occur on any
  handle in the handle set. If there is no current leader thread, for example, due to
  events arriving faster than the available threads can service them, the underlying
  operating system can queue events internally until a leader thread is available.
===> Follower thread promotion. After the leader thread has detected an new event, it
  uses the thread pool to choose a follower thread to become the new leader by using
  one of the promotion protocols described in implementation activity 5.
===> Event handler demultiplexing and event processing. After helping to promote a
  follower thread to become the new leader, the former leader thread then plays the
  role of a processing thread. This thread concurrently demultiplexes the event it
  detected to the event's associated handler and then dispatches the handler's hook
  method to process the event. A processing thread can execute concurrently with
  the leader thread and any other threads that are in the processing state.
===> Rejoining the thread pool. After the processing thread has run its event handling
  to completion, it can rejoin the thread pool and wait to process another event. A
  processing thread can become the leader immediately if there is no current leader
  thread. Otherwise, the processing thread returns to playing the role of a follower
  thread and waits on the thread pool synchronizer until it is promoted by a leader
  thread.
