HOWTO USE
To use you have to add src/akula folder to your project's include path and link the project against pthread library.
During project's configuration the existence of pthread library is checked and if found "-lpthread" is added to config's ($LIBS)

EXAMPLES
For now the only available documentation and examples are the example HTTP server under src/http_server
and the unit tests under src/unit_tests/tests
