2. Startup
After extracting the archive, start Viewer.exe in the "bin" subfolder. You should be prompted with
a dialog selecting the "Plugins" and "Media" subfolders. This is so OViSE knows where to find the
resources and plugins. If you ever happen to move the directories, check your registry for the
OViSE-key and either change values there or delete the key (you'll be prompted with the dialog
again).

3. Notes
This precompiled version of OViSE is intended if you want a short "test drive" of what it looks
like. The default scene contains some sample entities and you should be able to load a simple 
PLY pointcloud file. Keep in mind though, that OViSE is intended as a development framework, so 
using the source and adapting the application to your needs is its real purpose. 

The provided DLLs are need for the Ogre3D engine and are bundled for convenience.

See also the separate license for the provided 3D models and textures.
