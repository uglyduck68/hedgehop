REM Finally, make the zipfile.

REM Rename the zip file to match that of the msi. This assumes
REM that there is one and only one *.msi file in the destination
REM subdirectory.  If it isn't, the behaviour is undefined.
REM (%%~nf expands %1 to a file name with no extension)
pushd %CONDOROUTPUTDIR%
for %%f in (*.msi) do move /y condor.zip %%~nf.zip

echo. & echo *** Done. MSI package created. Congrats! Go drink absinthe.
