/* This file gets included before site.def in Imake.tmpl and is intended
to hold various truths about our build environment. If you'd like to add
a build-wide definition DO IT IN CONFIGURE.AC and in the appropriate
other places!!! This file is really only here to allow site.def to be
ONE line and we can git ignore changes in it since it is algorithmcally
modified and people often check in the changes by accident. */
