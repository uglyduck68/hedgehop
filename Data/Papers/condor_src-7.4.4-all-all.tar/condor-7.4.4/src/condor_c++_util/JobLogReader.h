		/** Notes on Keys:
		 **
		 ** Keys are in the form of: ClusterId.ProcId
		 **
		 ** Keys are for two types of ClassAds: Cluster and
		 ** Job. Cluster ads are the parent of all Job ads that share
		 ** the same ClusterId. This is typically called Chaining, and
		 ** allow for attributes common to all jobs in a cluster to
		 ** live in a single location - it is a space saving
		 ** optimization for both in memory and on disk job ads.
		 **
		 ** To distinguish a key for a cluster vs a job, a cluster's
		 ** key's ClusterId always begins with a 0 and its ProcId is
		 ** -1. The portion of the ClusterId after the 0 is shared
		 ** with all jobs in that cluster. There is only one cluster
		 ** ad per cluster.
		 **
		 ** For instance, key = 01.-1 is the cluster ad for cluster
		 ** 1, and key = 1.0 is a job in cluster 1.
		 **/

		/** Notes on Ordering:
		 **
		 ** There is no guarantee that a Cluster ad will appear in
		 ** NewClassAd before Job ads for the cluster.
		 **
		 ** There is no guarantee on the order which attributes will
		 ** arrive following a NewClassAd. An error can be signaled if
		 ** a SetAttribute for a key preceeds NewClassAd for that key.
