"The UID_DOMAIN parameter is used to decide under which user to run your "

"UID_DOMAIN on the machine that runs your job, then Condor will run the job "
"as the user called 'nobody'. If the UID_DOMAIN is the same on both the "
"submit and execute machines, then Condor will run the job as the user that "
"submitted the job. You need to set your UID_DOMAIN to a real domain name, "
"since Condor compares the submit machine's claimed UID_DOMAIN to its fully "
"qualified name. When Condor sends e-mail about a job, Condor sends the e-"
"mail to user@UID_DOMAIN. You could also enter '*' to match all domains "
"(security hole) or leaved it undefined (all jobs run as 'nobody')."
