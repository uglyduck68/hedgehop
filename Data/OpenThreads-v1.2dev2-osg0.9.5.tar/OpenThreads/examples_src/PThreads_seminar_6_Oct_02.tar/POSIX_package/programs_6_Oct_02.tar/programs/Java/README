These are the programs from Bil's course and book.
You are welcome to use them as you see fit, but be
aware that there is a bug in them and I don't know
where it is! (Meaning don't build an important system
with this code unless YOU verify it.)

The book describes most of these programs in some 
detail. Otherwise, they are not extensively documented.
